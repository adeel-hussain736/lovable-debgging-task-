# üõ† Bug Fixes Documentation - Lead Capture System (v2.0.0)

## Overview

This update documents the critical and high-priority bugs resolved in the Lead Capture System. The fixes address core functional issues in the React form, the Supabase Edge Function for email delivery, and system configuration for secure deployment.

---

## Critical & Major Fixes

### 1. Missing Environment Variables

**File**: `.env` and configuration files
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**
Several required variables (Supabase URL, anon key, OpenAI key, Resend key) were absent in the environment setup. API keys were also exposed directly in the codebase.

**Root Cause**
No centralized environment configuration strategy was in place.

**Fix**
Created a `.env` file, added it to `.gitignore`, and organized keys between frontend (`VITE_`) and server.

---

### 2. Database Persistence Not Implemented

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**
Lead submissions were lost after refresh because they existed only in component state.

**Root Cause**
Omitted Supabase `.insert()` during form submission.

**Fix**
Added a proper insert query with error handling for durable storage.

---

### 3. Incorrect AI Output Retrieval

**File**: `send-confirmation` function
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**
Emails were sent without AI-generated personalization because the system referenced `choices[1]` instead of `choices[0]`.

**Root Cause**
Wrong index assumption about the OpenAI response array.

**Fix**
Changed to `choices[0]` for valid personalized text.

---

### 4. Duplicate Email Sending

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**
Users received the same confirmation email twice after submitting the form.

**Root Cause**
Two identical `supabase.functions.invoke` calls existed in the flow.

**Fix**
Removed the extra call and kept one, wrapped in try/catch for safety.

---

### 5. Weak Error Handling in Submission Flow

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**
When something failed, there was no clear error feedback to users.

**Root Cause**
No error state or exception handling.

**Fix**
Added try/catch blocks, mapped common errors to friendly messages, and displayed them in the UI.

---

### 6. CORS Issues on Email Function

**File**: `send-confirmation` function
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**
Requests failed from certain browsers due to incomplete preflight CORS handling.

**Root Cause**
`OPTIONS` requests lacked proper headers and method allowances.

**Fix**
Added full `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers and handled `OPTIONS` requests properly.

---

### 7. No UI Lock During Processing

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**
Users could click ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù repeatedly, creating duplicate entries.

**Root Cause**
No disabled state or loading indicator while waiting for the API response.

**Fix**
Implemented an `isSubmitting` flag to disable the button and show a spinner until completion.

---

### 8. Queue Position Display Inaccurate

**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Low
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

**Problem**
The displayed ‚Äúqueue position‚Äù was based on local state, not actual database numbers.

**Root Cause**
Used `leads.length` instead of a Supabase count query.

**Fix**
Replaced local counting with a DB `count` query for accurate positioning.

---

## Example `.env` File

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://supabase-instance-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=anon_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key
```
